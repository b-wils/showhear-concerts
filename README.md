# Showhear Concerts
Site for browsing upcoming concerts. See it live at http://showhear-concerts.herokuapp.com/
## Background
This was the first website I built. Tech stack is Node, Express, Mongo, JQuery. The site will pull upcoming concerts from Songkick, artist genre information from last.fm and videos from Youtube.

The project is very disorganized but I learned a lot while making it.
## Running the site
Clone the repo
Install node modules

```
npm install
```

Copy env.sample to .env and add your own environment variables

Run the site
```
npm start
```
